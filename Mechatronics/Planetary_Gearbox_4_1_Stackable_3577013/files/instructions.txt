When printing gears, slow is best. Personally I went with 0.15mm layer height, 45 mm/s print speed, but it’s up to you.
Strength is largely determined by Infill. I’d recommend at least 30% - unless Lost PLA Casting, in which case 10% is fine.
No supports are necessary.



To PRINT one 4 : 1 gearbox:
1 x carrier
1 x cover
3 x planets
1 x ring
1 x sun
If you struggle with assembly, have a look at this video: https://youtu.be/0ow4x0jadJY where I put it together a couple of time (and convert a 3D print into metal)



To PRINT a drill attachment spinning gear
1 x drill-gear
1 x drill-spindle
Lightly sand the spindle to fit and apply glue. Insert into hole in gear. 



Stack gearboxes to increase ration:
1 box = 4:1
2 boxes = 16:1
3 boxes = 64:1
4 boxes = 256:1
5 boxes = 1024:1
6 boxes = 4096:1
7 boxes = 16384:1
8 boxes = 65536:1
9 boxes = 262144:1
10 boxes = 1048576:1



BOLTS
As this is a stackable system, I’ve included 6mm holes around the design. 
I would recommend using 6mm threaded rod or bolts, together with appropriate washers and bolts, to fix gearboxes together.
